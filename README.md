## Addon description<br> 
-----------------------Introduction-----------------------<br> 
This is an old gamemode (AMX Modx) that I played a lot, so I decided to make a GMOD version.<br> 
I designed this gamemode to be fully customized. Wanna change something? You can!

-----------------------About-----------------------<br>
Play Zombie Plague is easier than You imagine:<br>
If You are an human, kill the zombies.<br> 
If You are a zombie: Infect the humans (And kill the last human).<br> 

As You do that, You will earn ammo packs to spend on extra items.<br> 

So... Pickup your weapons and start the fight for the human kind!<br> 

-----------------------Features-----------------------<br> 
This gamemode is a easy customization mod.<br> 

By default, zombie plague has:
- Zombie and Human classes. *
- 6 round types. *
- Multi language support. *
- Extra Items support. *
- Bank system (To storage your ammo packs).
- Fully customization by server cvars.
- Votemap *
- Map manager (To custom cvars for a map/prefix type (zp_*))
- GMOD weapons *
- Custom weapons support (So you can add workshop weapons like M9K weapons) *
- "Plug" and play (You don't need custom maps to play Zombie Plague).
- Zombie Escape support. *
- Huge API for developers.

(*) All items You can create new ones and modify.<br> 

-----------------------Zombie Plague Classes-----------------------<br> 
Every Zombie Plague class has it's own characteristic (More health/speed/gravity).<br> 
So you can make a custom Zombie/Human class as your will.<br> 

-----------------------Round Types-----------------------<br> 
Single Infection round - One random player will be infected and He should infect other players.<br> 
Multi Infection Round - Same thing as Single Infection Round, the difference is there are more<br>  zombies.<br> 
Swarm Mod Round - Half of players are zombies, Half of players are humans. There's no infection,<br>  only deaths.<br> 
Plague Mod - Same as Swarm Mod, the difference is that there is one nemesis and one survivor.<br>
Nemesis Round - Everybody except one random player (that is going to be the nemesis) will be<br>  human. Nemesis should kill every human  (Nemesis cause more damage).<br> 
Survivor Round - Everybody except one random player (that is going to be the survivor) will be<br>  zombie. Survivor should kill every zombie (Survivor cause more damage).<br> 

-----------------------Multi Language support-----------------------<br> 
By default this gamemode supports US English, Brazilian Portuguese, Argentine Spanish, Russian, Ukrainian, French, Traditional Chinese, Japanese and Korean.<br> 
But You can add more languages on languages folder.<br> 

-----------------------Extra items-----------------------<br> 
Extra items are a good way to spend your ammo packs.<br> 
You can use them to obtain advantage against your oppenent.<br> 

-----------------------Bank System-----------------------<br> 
By default Zombie Plague has a bank system. So you can storage your ammopacks during the round.<br>
You can create your own storage mod. So you can use databases (Like MySQL) to store player's ammopacks
